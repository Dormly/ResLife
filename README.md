# Dormly ResLife

Dormly ResLife is Dormly's resident management software. Dormly ResLife is created using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Supabase, and (currently) NextAuth. Dormly ResLife hopes to streamline the process of managing all things residential living for colleges through a better UI/UX and modern features including, but not limited to:

- Task management
  - _We believe that scheduled tasks provide an opportunity to greatly increase communication and effectiveness amongst RAs. With tasks that can be created with various criteria and due dates, RAs can focus on doing their job, not about what they should be doing. Effective task management also makes things easier for administrators to manage RAs, and keep track of their own work._
- Personalized dashboards
  - _Many current solutions for residential living have a building-first strucutre. RAs can view buildings with residents and view information that way. Dormly ResLife seeks to have a user-focused approach, providing information on the residents that RAs are likely to care about in a way that is relevant to them, not to the building._
- Using Data to Increase Efficiency
  - _Universities collect and have access to loads of information about their students, especially those that live on-campus. Dormly ResLife plans to leverage this to streamline many of the absolutely essential job functions of RAs, like reporting._

### Local Development

To spin up a local development environment, clone this repository to your machine, open a terminal to the root directory of the cloned repository, and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

Currently, no independent local development state is maintained for users outside of the organization, as databases and environment variables would need to be configured. This task is left to the cloner for the forseeable future, and this project will eventually become closed-source.

If you configure these properly, you can spin up a development server by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```
